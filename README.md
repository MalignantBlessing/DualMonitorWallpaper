# Introduction
Hello, this program allows users to set their desktop wallpaper to be images of their choice for two monitors. It was written entirely in C#
and was just intended for personal use to begin with.

I have no issue with anyone utilizing or altering any/all code as they wish, provided there is no ill intent of course.

This is the first project I've uploaded to GitHub and, though it is fully functional, the purpose of publishing it is so that the code
can be critiqued and improved so that I can become better at programming.
Any and all valid criticism is welcome and encouraged (e.g. this could be an issue because..., or that could be more efficient, etc.)

All code was created and implemented by myself alone (with minimal stackoverflow help here and there), EXCEPT for actually setting the wallpaper
in Windows after the image has been created. Unfortunately, I can't find the source for this specific piece of code (as I originally started
this project a good while ago). If anyone can find the link to this then I will be sure to add it as a reference.

# Features
• Allows users who have two mointors to set images of their choice as their desktop wallpaper  
• Allows users to specify their monitor resolutions so that the images can be properly placed  
• Allows users to preview their wallpaper before actually setting it  
• Has measures in place to prevent errors and crashes - should be fairly robust  
• Has a completely custom graphical interface (painstakingly) created by myself using Adobe Photoshop  

# Potential Improvements
• Better accessibility and more variety in monitor resolutions (currently limited to an aspect ration of 16:9 and only three different resolutions)  
• A minimize button (to be honest I'm just lazy)  
• An indicator of some sort when the user is in Preview Mode  
• Any other recommendations will be considered as well

# Additional Notes
I went out of my way to create the project based on .NET Framework 4.6.1 because it means that the final release is a single executable file rather than
a whole bunch of loose files along with an executable. Not sure what relevance this has, just thought I'd mention it.  
Again, any valid criticism is welcome and encouraged. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)
