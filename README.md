# Introduction
Hello, this program allows users to set their desktop wallpaper to be images of their choice for two monitors. It was written entirely in C#
and was just intended for personal use to begin with.

I have no issue with anyone utilizing or altering any/all code as they wish, as long as you provide credit.

This is the first project I've uploaded to GitHub and, though it is fully functional, the purpose of publishing it is so that the code
can be critiqued and improved so that I can become better at programming.
Any valid criticism is welcome and encouraged (e.g. this could be an issue because..., or that could be more efficient, etc.)  
Explantions of the criticism would also be greatly appreciated as it would help develop my understanding of programming (simply stating
'this is bad; do this instead' isn't particularly helpful).

All code was created and implemented by myself alone (with minimal stackoverflow help here and there), EXCEPT for actually setting the wallpaper
in Windows after the image has been created. Unfortunately, I can't find the source for this specific piece of code (as I originally started
this project a good while ago). If anyone can find the link to this then I will be sure to add it as a reference.

# Features
• Allows users who have two mointors to set images of their choice as their desktop wallpaper  
• Allows users to specify their monitor resolutions so that the images can be properly placed  
• Allows users to preview their wallpaper before actually setting it  
• Has measures in place to prevent errors and crashes - should be fairly robust  
• Has a completely custom graphical interface (painstakingly) created by myself using Adobe Photoshop  

# Potential Improvements
• Better accessibility and more variety of monitor resolutions (currently limited to an aspect ration of 16:9 and only three different resolutions)  
• A minimize button (to be honest I'm just lazy)  
• An indicator of some sort when the user is in Preview Mode  
• More detailed commenting for the sake of readability and clarity  
• Any other recommendations will be considered as well

# Additional Notes
I went out of my way to create the project based on .NET Framework 4.6.1 because it means that the final release is a single executable file rather than
a whole bunch of loose files along with an executable. Not sure what relevance this has, just thought I'd mention it.  
Also, this may conflict with some anti-virus programs and I'm not sure what can be done about that, so my apologies for any inconvenience. If anyone is
able to provide any tips or info to help mitigate this then that would be great.  
Again, any valid criticism is welcome and encouraged. Thank you for taking the time to read this. :)
